# school-management-system

The idea is to create a comprehensive school management system that would just deal with students, faculty, and funds.
It doesnâ€™t cover the issues of attendance, bus tracking, schedules, etc. It is rather aimed for mentors to implement a money management system for a school.
While creating a project, you will learn Collection methods in Java, as well as Object Oriented Programming concepts and can understand the use of methods, variables, classes.
